# Anamolous point: ebind = 2 kcal/mol. Reversing the trend of the rest of the ebind values, the PE INCREASES at the start. Some of this is due to thermostat fluctuations, but the trend after the first big jump is also positive. 80000 was chosen as the eq 2 point since it appeared to follow this initial positive trend. Unsure why the thermostat jump is positive rather than negative.
# ebind = 14 kcal/mol was done using 5 times the number of time steps as everything else (for 2-12 it was 5 000 000 time steps, every 5 000 time steps, 14 it was 25 000 000 time steps, every 5 000 timesteps, 16 is 50 000 000 time steps, every 50 000 time steps, 18 is 100 000 000 time steps, every 100 000 time steps, and 20 is 500 000 000 time steps, every 500 000 time steps.

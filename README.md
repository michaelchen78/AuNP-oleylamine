# AuNP-oleylamine
Using lammps MD simulations to study the interactions between gold nanoparticles and oleylamine ligands.


In lieu of README I have added a pdf called 'MC_NOTES' which contains a summary of my work and this repo.

## Notes on the upload
This repository is essentially a backup of what was on my local computer when I was finished with my time on the project, and should include all material referenced in ```MC_NOTES.pdf```. See commit notes for more specific details of certain files which were excluded. The rest of the files that may be useful can be found in chpc (all not in this repo), for example u1276798@kingspeak26.chpc.utah.edu; if the password is needed please email michael NOSPACE o NOSPACE chen78 AT gmail DOT com.
